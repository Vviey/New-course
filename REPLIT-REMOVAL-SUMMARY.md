# Replit Dependency Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove Replit-specific dependencies from the codebase to enable smooth local development.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### Client-Side Changes
- Removed Replit script references from client/index.html
- Created empty placeholder versions of:
  - client/src/replit-patch.js
  - client/src/vite-config-helper.js
- Confirmed no Replit references in client-side code

### Server-Side Changes
- Created empty placeholder version of server/replit-config.ts
- Verified no imports of replit-config.ts in server code
- Checked all server files for Replit references

### Configuration Files
- Created local-package.json (without Replit dependencies)
- Created local-tailwind.config.js (in CommonJS format)
- Created .env.example with sample environment variables
- Updated Vite configuration to work in local development

### Runtime Scripts
- Created run-local.js (Node.js script to run both servers)
- Created run-local.sh (Unix shell script wrapper)

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with local development instructions
- Created detailed LOCAL-SETUP.md guide
- Added steps for replacing configuration files before installation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Replit Files (Not Deleted)

These files were not deleted as they might be required for the Replit environment:
- .replit
- replit.nix

For local development, these files are ignored, and the application uses the clean configuration files instead.

## üîÑ Local Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Replace configuration files:
   ```bash
   cp local-package.json package.json
   cp local-tailwind.config.js tailwind.config.js
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node run-local.js
   ```

## üîç Verification

The application was tested with the following checks:
- ‚úÖ No hard-coded Replit domains or references
- ‚úÖ All configuration files have clean versions
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set to skip Replit-specific functionality
- ‚úÖ Local development scripts created and tested

## üìù Notes

- The application now uses conditional loading logic to determine whether to load Replit-specific code
- Environment variables (LOCAL_DEV, SKIP_REPLIT) control this behavior
- The in-memory storage solution is used by default for local development
- No database configuration is needed for local testing
