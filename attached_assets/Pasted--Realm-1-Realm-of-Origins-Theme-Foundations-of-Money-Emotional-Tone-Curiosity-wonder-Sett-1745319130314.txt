🪙 Realm 1: Realm of Origins
Theme: Foundations of Money
 Emotional Tone: Curiosity, wonder
 Setting: Trade festival at sunset, colorful market stalls, sounds of drums and laughter, barter exchanges happening all around.

Opening Storyline:
Asha walks through the crowded festival, holding her grandmother’s hand. She sees people exchanging food, bracelets, and herbs—not for money, but for other goods.
Asha (wide-eyed): “Why do we use paper to buy things now? Didn’t people trade without it before?”
Odu (appearing behind her, cloaked in sunset light): “Before coins clinked and notes crumpled, stories were the ledger. Walk the path of what came before... and you’ll know what was lost.”
