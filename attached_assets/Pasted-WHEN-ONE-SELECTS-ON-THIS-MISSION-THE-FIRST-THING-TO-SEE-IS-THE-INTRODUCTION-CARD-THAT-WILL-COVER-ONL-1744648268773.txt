CHALLENGE:
Before Bitcoin, societies moved from barter to shells, gold, and paper money. But why? Imagine you’re in an ancient African village, and you need to trade your goods. You have three options:
🔘 Option 1: Barter – Trade your goods directly.
🔘 Option 2: Cowrie Shells – A widely accepted form of money.
🔘 Option 3: Gold Coins – A scarce but heavy form of money.


Question: Which option do you choose, and why?
Correct Answer: Option 2 or 3 (barter is too inefficient).
Feedback: Explain why barter was replaced by more efficient money systems.

CARD1: 

Barter Trade – The First Exchange System
Before money, people exchanged goods and services directly—like trading a basket of yams for a goat. But barter had problems:
 ❌ Hard to find the right trade (double coincidence of wants)
 ❌ Difficult to measure value (how many chickens equal one cow?)
 ❌ No way to store wealth long-term
CARD2
Commodity Money – Shells, Gold, and Other Valuables
To solve barter issues, societies started using scarce and durable items as money:
 🔹 Cowrie shells in Africa and Asia
 🔹 Gold and silver coins in Europe and the Middle East
 🔹 Salt, beads, and cattle in different cultures
While better than barter, commodity money had its flaws:
 ❌ Heavy and hard to transport
 ❌ Could be easily stolen
 ❌ Supply wasn’t always predictable

CARD3
Paper Money – The Birth of Government-Issued Currency
Governments and banks introduced paper money backed by gold or silver. It was easier to carry and made trade faster.
 ✅ Lighter than metal coins
 ✅ Allowed large transactions
But over time, governments removed the gold backing and printed money freely, leading to:
 ❌ Inflation (money losing value over time)
 ❌ Governments controlling people’s wealth

CARD4
Digital Money – Banks and Online Transactions
With the rise of computers, money became digital—credit cards, mobile banking, and online payments. Now, most money exists only as numbers on a screen.
 ✅ Instant transactions
 ✅ No need to carry cash
But there’s a catch:
 ❌ Banks can freeze or control your money
 ❌ High remittance fees for sending money across borders
 ❌ Prone to fraud and cyber-attacks

CARD5
Bitcoin – A New Financial Revolution
Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a decentralized, digital form of money. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin:
 ✅ Can’t be controlled by any government or bank
 ✅ Has a fixed supply (only 21 million will ever exist)
 ✅ Enables fast and low-cost transactions worldwide
Bitcoin takes the best qualities of past money systems without their weaknesses. Now, it’s time to see why it’s changing the game! THIS IS A POP UP AFTER CLICKING CHALLENGE

CHALLENGE 2:
You are a merchant in a growing digital economy. You’ve experienced barter, commodity money, paper money, and digital banking. Now, Bitcoin is becoming more widely used. Some traders trust it, but others are skeptical. You need to make a decision. Pick the best reason why Bitcoin is a better financial system than past money forms:
🔘 Option 1: Bitcoin is controlled by governments, ensuring stability.
🔘 Option 2: Bitcoin is scarce, decentralized, and allows global transactions.
🔘 Option 3: Bitcoin can be printed like paper money, so there will always be enough.
Correct Answer: Option 2 (Bitcoin is decentralized, scarce, and global).
Feedback:
• If Correct: Great! Bitcoin takes the best aspects of money evolution while fixing key weaknesses like inflation and centralization.
• If Incorrect: Think again! Bitcoin isn’t controlled by governments, and its supply is fixed at 21 million coins.
