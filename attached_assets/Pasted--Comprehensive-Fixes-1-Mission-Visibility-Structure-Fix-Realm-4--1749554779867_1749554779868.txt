### **Comprehensive Fixes

#### **1. Mission Visibility & Structure**  
- **Fix Realm 4 Missions:**  
  - Ensure **all missions** in Realm 4 are visible (not just the first).  
  - Check for missing `map()` loops, incorrect state handling, or conditional rendering bugs.  
  
- **Reuse Existing Files:**  
  - Do **not** create new files—restructure content inside `realmX-missions.tsx` (X = 1-7).  
  - Ensure **every mission** is properly linked and rendered in its respective realm.  

#### **2. Navigation & Routing**  
- **Global Navigation Bar (Fix & Standardize):**  
  - Must appear on **every page in all missions and every relevant page** (Realms 1-7):  
    - Back to Missions  
    - Profile  
    - Map  
    - Badges  
    - Next Realm  
  - Ensure buttons **work correctly** (no dead links).  
- **In-Mission Navigation (Fix & Standardize):**  
  - **Previous / Next buttons** must appear in **every mission** (Realms 1-7).  
  - Ensure they **cycle through missions smoothly** (no skips or crashes).  

#### **3. Realm 3 Simulations (Critical Fix)**  
- **Make Simulations Visible:**  
  
  - Ensure learners can **access all simulations** (check for hidden routes or missing links).  
  - Test:  
    - Are simulations loading?  
    - Are they interactive?  
    - Do they match the learning objectives?  


#### **5. UI/UX Overhaul**  
- **Remove Content Card Wrapper:**  
  - Delete the enclosing box—render content **directly on screen** for a cleaner look.  
- **Color & Theme Consistency:**  
  - Match mission UI to each realm’s 
- **Font & Spacing Fixes:**  
  - Increase text size for readability.  
    
  

#### **7. Testing Checklist**  
Before finalizing:  
✅ **Test all missions** in Realms 1-7 (ensure none are missing).  
✅ **Test all buttons** (navigation, next/previous, simulations).  
✅ **Test Realm 7 questions** (interactivity, feedback).  
✅ **Verify UI** (no card wrapper, proper colors, readable text).

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- A **fully functional, polished, and consistent** learning experience across **all realms**.  
- No broken missions, navigation, or simulations.  
- Engaging, in-depth Bitcoin content with interactive quizzes.  

also notice that in the auth page we do not have a forot passowrd follow the ui in the auth page and create the forgot passowrd and link it when one clicks the forgot password button

inside missions when one click the simulaton test this if it takes them to the correct one and fix
