#### 📁 **Component Structure and Content Migration**

* In **Realm 1**, mission content is placed inside `components/missions.tsx`. Replicate this architecture for **Realms 2 through 7**, such that:

  * Each realm has its mission content abstracted into reusable component files like `components/missions.tsx`.mission-id:...
  * The actual page files like `pages/realmX-missions.tsx` should simply import and render this content cleanly.

#### 🧭 **Routing and Visibility Fixes**

* In **Realm 3**, the **simulations** currently located in `pages/realm3/...simulations` are not visible to learners. Refactor so that:

  * Simulations are clearly integrated within the Realm 3 mission flow.
  * Ensure learners can discover and access simulations naturally, either by embedding them in missions or linking them from the realm mission menu or map.
  * Use dynamic routing if necessary to support deep linking.

#### 📝 **Quiz and Answer System Overhaul (Realm 7)**

* In **Realm 7 missions**, especially those containing quiz questions:

  * Convert all questions from static Q\&A format into:

    * **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)** with one correct answer.
    * **Input Fields** for short answers, with logic to check correctness.
  * Implement **answer validation** with:

    * ✅ Green highlight for correct answers.
    * ❌ Red highlight for wrong answers.
    * Show the **correct answer** and a brief **feedback message** after submission.

#### 🔁 **Realm Navigation & Mission UX Consistency**

* Ensure **all realms (2–7)** missions include the following navigation components:

  * “Back to Realm Missions”
  * “Profile”, “Badge Map”, and “Next Realm”
  * “Previous” and “Next Mission” buttons at the top of each mission. like in realm1 missions
* Maintain consistent styling, placement, and visibility across all mission pages.

#### 📚 **Mission Content Enhancement**

* Expand the mission content significantly across all realms (2–7):

  * Ensure each mission is **comprehensive, deeply explanatory**, and reflects a **rich Bitcoin curriculum**.
  * Cover **technical**, **historical**, **economic**, and **social** dimensions of Bitcoin wherever relevant.
  * Avoid brevity—treat each mission like a full chapter in an advanced learning course.

#### 🎨 **UI & Theming Improvements**

* In all missions (Realms 1–7):

  * **Remove the card wrapper** currently boxing the content — allow full-screen width or more fluid layout to enhance readability.
  * Apply a **custom theme color scheme per realm** so the UI visually reflects the identity of each realm:

    * Realm 1: 
    * Realm 2: 
    * Realm 3: 
    * Realm 4: 
    * Realm 5: 
    * Realm 6: 
    * Realm 7:
