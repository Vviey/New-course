🎭 Character Interactions (Example Dialogues)
🌅 Realm of Origins — Mission 1.1: "The First Exchange"
Asha (curious): "Why would someone trade a chicken for a bag of salt? How did they know it was fair?"
Guide (Mekatiriri): "Ah, child of the sun — long before paper or coins, fairness came from trust, and value was shared in stories, not prices."

🏙️ Central Citadel — Mission 2.3: "Surveillance & Censorship"
Asha (alarmed): "Wait… the bank can freeze your money if they disagree with you?"
Mekatiriri: "Yes, and they have. Control of money is control of life. But not all money is so easily chained."

🌌 Forest of Sparks — Mission 3.1: "The Spark of Satoshi"
Asha (whispers): "Who… is Satoshi?"
Mekatiriri: "A ghost, a rebel, or a spirit of code. But more importantly — Satoshi gave us the torch. Now we must carry it."

⛰️ Mountain Forge — Mission 4.1: "The Power of the Puzzle"
Asha (fascinated): "So… they solve puzzles with machines to keep the money safe?"
Mekatiriri: "Yes, and those puzzles are the gates. Only the honest and the strong may pass."

🌳 Council of Forks — Mission 5.2: "Soft Fork vs Hard Fork"
Asha: "Why do they argue about how Bitcoin should change?"
Mekatiriri: "Because this isn’t just software. It’s a people’s money. And every fork is a choice of future."

🛖 Ubuntu Village — Mission 6.1: "Real Use Cases in Africa"
Asha (amazed): "So she used Bitcoin to sell her produce — without banks?"
Mekatiriri: "Indeed. Freedom blooms not in code, but in what we grow with it."

🌠 Grove of Becoming — Mission 7.5: "Final Knowledge Test"
Asha: "I’ve walked through markets, towers, forests, and fire. Am I ready now?"
