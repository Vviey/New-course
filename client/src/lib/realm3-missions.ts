        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The Lightning Network is a "layer 2" payment protocol that operates on top of Bitcoin. It enables fast transactions between participating nodes and has been proposed as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">While Bitcoin's base layer provides transparent, censorship-resistant transactions, the Lightning Network adds several important features:</p>

            <h3 style="color: #FF9933; margin-top: 0; font-size: 18px;">1. Opening Payment Channels</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Two parties create an on-chain transaction that locks up some bitcoin, creating a payment channel between them</p>
          </div>

            <h3 style="color: #FF9933; margin-top: 0; font-size: 18px;">2. Multiple Transactions</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Once a channel is open, the parties can conduct unlimited transactions between them without touching the blockchain</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When finished, either party can close the channel, settling the final balances to the blockchain</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The Lightning Network introduces several privacy enhancements over regular Bitcoin transactions:</p>
        
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Payment channels</strong> mask transaction details from the public blockchain</li>
          <li><strong>Onion routing</strong> ensures intermediary nodes can't determine payment source or destination</li>
          <li><strong>Atomic swaps</strong> enable cross-chain trading without centralized exchanges</li>
          <li><strong>Evolving standards</strong> continuously improve privacy protections</li>
        </ul>
