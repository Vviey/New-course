They agreed to implement SegWit first, followed by a hard fork to increase the block size to 2MB within six months. This became known as the New York Agreement (NYA).",reasons:["Lack of developer support: Most Bitcoin Core developers opposed the hard fork, believing it was unnecessary and too rushed","Community resistance: Much of the Bitcoin user community rejected an agreement made behind closed doors by large businesses","Lack of replay protection: The proposal initially lacked proper replay protection, creating risk for users' funds","Technical concerns: The timeline was considered too aggressive for the testing needed for a safe hard fork","Philosophical disagreements: Many believed the initiative undermined Bitcoin's decentralized governance model"],stakeholders:{developers:"Most Bitcoin Core developers opposed SegWit2x, with only a small team working on its implementation.",miners:"Initially, miners representing over 80% of hash power supported the proposal, but many withdrew support as opposition grew.",users:"Most vocal users on forums and social media opposed the hard fork, seeing it as a corporate takeover attempt.",businesses:"Major businesses like Coinbase, Bitpay, and several large miners initially supported the agreement but many later reversed position."},lessons:["Closed-door agreements by a subset of stakeholders cannot override broader community consensus","Technical consensus among developers is crucial for protocol changes","Hard forks require extensive preparation, testing, and community buy-in","Bitcoin's governance prioritizes conservative change and resistance to centralized decision-making"],consequences:"The SegWit2x proposal was abandoned just days before its planned activation in November 2017.
